# Random_number_game
A simple game that involves guessing random numbers.
It prompts you to give the upper limit if the range from which you will be choosing the random number, which must be greater than 5.
The lower limit is zero.
It tells you whether the guess you made is correct, if incorrect it informs whether it is above or below the random number.
It then prints the number of attempts it took to get the answer.
